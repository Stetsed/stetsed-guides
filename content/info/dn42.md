I am part of the decentralized DN42 Network as a hobby project to test out technologies like BGP and others. The information for myself is listed below and if you wish to request a peering I am available for Wireguard Peering over public IPv4 using Link Local IPv6 addresses is preffered. If you want to peer with me please contact me via [email](mailto:dn42@selfhostable.net) or via Matrix where my username is @asdwasdw:matrix.org and I am in the DN42 Room.

I will also be writing a blog post about my experiences with DN42 and how to get started with it in the future. As I noticed that a few things where missing in the Wiki so I will also be submitting it upstream but I hope I can also help some people with my blog post.
